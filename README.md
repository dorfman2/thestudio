Interactive sound-scape for DC ArtoMAtic 2015. 

For Raspberry Pi Python, utilizes the GPIO pins and mounted switches. Participants in this installation enter the room, and are invited to push buttons (different objects to the viewer). This affects the sound-scape playing in the room.


raspi-audio-button.py was an early test of the code based on Ladyada's tutorial
